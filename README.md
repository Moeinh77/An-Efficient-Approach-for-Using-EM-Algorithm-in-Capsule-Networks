**Abstract**:
```
Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are brand-new architectures that have shown ground-breaking results in certain areas of
Computer Vision (CV). In 2017, Hinton and his team introduced CapsNets with routing-by-agreement in "Sabour et al" 
and in a more recent paper "Matrix Capsules with EM Routing" they proposed a more complete architecture with 
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this architecture
is able to preserve the pose of the objects in the picture. Due to this characteristic, it has been able to beat the
previous state-of-theart results on the smallNORB dataset, which includes samples with various view points. Also, this
architecture is more robust to white box adversarial attacks. However, CapsNets have two major drawbacks. They can't 
perform as well as CNNs on complex datasets and, they need a huge amount of time for training. We try to mitigate these
shortcomings by finding optimum settings of EM routing iterations for training CapsNets. Unlike the past studies, we use un-equal 
numbers of EM routing iterations for different stages of the CapsNet. For our research, we use three datasets: Yale face dataset,
Belgium Traffic Sign dataset, and Fashion-MNIST dataset.
